### If you share this addon, please link directly to the [release page](https://github.com/TeoTwawki/renamer-windower/releases) for downloads rather than placing it someplace like dropbox. This ensures people get the latest version and I get legit bug reports.<br> :) <br>Thank you.

## Things You Can Do With This Addon:

- **Rename known or suspected NM placeholders.**

- **Create non standard NPCs on a private server and give your players a list file to name them.**

- **Rename Ken in Bastok Markets to something mean for having such a vile escort quest.** 
Screw you, Ken.  ðŸ˜ƒ
